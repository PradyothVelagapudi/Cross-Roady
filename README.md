# Cross-Roady
Cross Roady: A road-crossing game coded in JavaFX. Made as a CSE205 Honors Project for the Fall 2022 Semester.

To play it yourself: download CrossRoady.jar and run. Requires JRE 1.8.

Note: Please ignore the poor structure and lack of modularity. This project was rushed for extra credit and I have
since grown as a person and a programmer.
